 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce two novel methods to design outer polar codes for two previously proposed concatenated polar code architectures: augmented polar codes and local-global polar codes. These methods include a stopping set (SS) construction and a nonstationary density evolution (NDE) construction. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of these methods over previously proposed constructions based on density evolution (DE) and LLR evolution.},
