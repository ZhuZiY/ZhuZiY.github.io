abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce two novel methods to design outer polar codes
  for two previously proposed concatenated polar code architectures: augmented polar
  codes and local-global polar codes. These methods include a stopping set (SS) construction
  and a nonstationary density evolution (NDE) construction. Simulation results demonstrate
  the advantage of these methods over previously proposed constructions based on density
  evolution (DE) and LLR evolution.'
